# Bloom Shader

This is an example of the bloom shader. Bloom shader is making a texture from dark parts of the current screen and blend it to the actual color and (should) blend it. This is a tentative of porting the XNA code from https://digitalerr0r.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/xna-shader-programming-tutorial-24-bloom/ to godot.
